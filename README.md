# Amazon ECS Service Connect Agent

![Amazon ECS logo](doc/ecs.png "Amazon AWS ECS")

The Amazon ECS Service Connect Agent is a primary component of [Amazon ECS Service Connect](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-connect.html) and [AWS App Mesh](https://aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/). It monitors the Envoy proxy and provides a management interface. This management interface serves as a safe endpoint to interact with the Envoy proxy and provides several APIs for health checks, telemetry data and summarizes the operating condition of the proxy. It is used in both ECS Service Connect proxy and App Mesh [Envoy Docker Image](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy.html).


## Building the Agent

On an [Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/). Download Go at https://go.dev/doc/install. In the project's `agent` directory, issue the `make` command to compile the agent binary:

```
$ yum -y install docker
$ yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
$ make
go fmt ./...
go test -mod=vendor -count=1 -v ./...
...
$ ls -laF agent
-rwxrwxr-x 1 ec2-user ec2-user 21192704 Feb  1 18:40 agent*
```


To create an Envoy image, you could use the following example files:

Example `Dockerfile.agent`:

```
COPY agent /usr/bin/agent

CMD /usr/bin/agent
```

Example `Makefile`:

```
AWS_REGION ?= us-west-2
SSM_PARAMETER = "/aws/service/appmesh/envoy"
IMAGE_STRING = $(shell aws --region $(AWS_REGION) ssm get-parameter --name $(SSM_PARAMETER) --query Parameter.Value)
ECR = $(shell echo $(IMAGE_STRING) | cut -d / -f 1)
IMAGE_NAME ?= "ecs-service-connect-agent:latest"

.PHONY: docker-build
docker-build:
        ECR=$(shell echo $(IMAGE_STRING) | sed 's/\(.*\):\(.*\)/\1/g')
        echo "FROM $(IMAGE_STRING)" > source
        cat source Dockerfile.agent > Dockerfile

        aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --password-stdin --username AWS $(ECR)
        docker build -t $(IMAGE_NAME) .
        rm source Dockerfile
```

Place these files along with the built `agent` binary in a single directory and issue the `make docker-build` command. The resulting `ecs-service-connect:latest` can be used in ECS Service Connect or App Mesh as a sidecar.

## Advanced Usage

The Amazon ECS Service Connect Agent supports using a few environment variables to alter some aspects of the Envoy's behavior. These variables are outlined below, and documented in the AWS App Mesh [User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/envoy-config.html). These environment variables can be configured when used with AWS App Mesh, and they are not configurable when used with ECS Service Connect.

|---	|---	|---	|---	|
|`ECS_CONTAINER_INSTANCE_ARN`  | `arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:container-instance/cluster-name/container-instance-id` | When set, used to send ECS container instance Arn information to management server for authorization purposes. |  |

### Deprecated

* `APPMESH_RESOURCE_NAME`
* `APPMESH_VIRTUAL_NODE_NAME`

### Management APIs

The Amazon ECS Service Connect Agent offers a local management interface when `APPNET_AGENT_ADMIN_MODE` is set. Following are the supported queries:

* `GET /status`: Returns Envoy operating information such as its connectivity state, restarts count, connection with control plane, health check, etc.
* `POST /drain_listeners`: Drains all inbound Envoy listeners.
* `POST /enableLogging?level=<desired_level>`: Change Envoy logging level across all loggers. The change is automatically reset after a duration configurable using `APPNET_AGENT_LOGGING_RESET_TIMEOUT` variable.
* `GET /stats/prometheus`: Returns Envoy statistics in Prometheus format.
* `GET /stats/prometheus?usedonly`: Only returns statistics that Envoy has updated.
* `GET /stats/prometheus?filter=metrics_extension`: Filters and returns only the statistics generated by [Metrics Extension](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/metrics.html#metrics-extension). Can be used in conjunction with `usedonly` parameter.
* `GET /stats/prometheus?usedonly&filter=metrics_extension&delta`: Returns a delta of the statistics computed using the latest snapshot retrieved from Envoy. Requires enabling the snapshotter using `ENABLE_STATS_SNAPSHOT` variable.
